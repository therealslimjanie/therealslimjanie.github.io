								<p>If you have never heard of Facebook, then either you are above the age of ninety years old or you truly live under a rock. A week and a half ago, I deleted my Facebook. To be completely honest, I have been wanting to delete my Facebook for some time now. I have been holding back though because it has been an incredible form of communication for me and my friends, but I also was able to buy vintage sorority clothes (which was really the only thing keeping me there). Facebook has been around for thirteen years now and it has developed into a massive media conglomerate. Facebook is not only a social media site; it is a marketplace, video creation platform, and a news source. This creation of media has allowed for Facebook to become the superior social media platform. But just because they seem like the best platform on the internet, that is far from the truth.</p>

									<p>In this podcast, we discuss whether or not Tik Tok is a national security threat and what are true feelings are about the app as a whole. We also discuss the age old favorite app, Vine, and how it is similar to Tik Tok. Does Congress really have to be worried about this lip syncing app, or are they just concerned because Tik Tok is a internationally owned company? Find out on the Security Studies Podcast!</p>
